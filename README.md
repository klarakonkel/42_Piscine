# 42_Piscine
The repository contains my solutions to the Piscine projects at 42 Berlin (Oct 2023).

42 is a rigorous computer programming school that is entirely free and available to students no matter of their academic background. The Piscine, a part of the admissions process to the core curriculum, is a 4-week intense coding training, where the participants become acquinted with C programming and Bash scripting.
42 teaching method is based on peer-to-peer, project learning. With a fully hands on appoach, they allow students to delve deep into code and thoroughly understand their work.

Throughout 26 days of the Piscine, the participants work on individual projects (evaluated by two peers and a strict grading software - Moulinette) as well as on weekend, group projects called Rushes. Each project is comprised of a few exercises, and the next project is available to start iff the previous one was passed.

Since all subjects to exercises are an intellectual property of the school, instead of posting the exact assignments I will briefly explain the logics of each program in README files.
